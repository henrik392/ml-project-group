# Experiment 3: Confidence Threshold Sweep
# Purpose: Find optimal conf threshold for F2 metric (recall-weighted)

experiment_id: exp03_conf_sweep
description: "Confidence threshold ablation for F2 optimization"

# Model configuration (use trained baseline)
model: yolo11n
weights: runs/train/yolo11n_baseline_fold0/weights/best.pt  # From exp02

# Dataset
data: configs/dataset_fold_0.yaml
fold_id: 0

# Training parameters (inference only, no training)
skip_training: true

# Inference configuration (sweep)
inference:
  mode: standard
  conf_sweep: [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3]  # Lower = more recall

# Notes
notes: |
  Sweep confidence thresholds to optimize F2 score.
  F2 weighs recall 5× more than precision, so lower thresholds expected to win.
  Use frozen weights from exp02 baseline.
  Goal: Find optimal threshold for maximum F2.
